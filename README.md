# Bank-Customer-Churn-Prediction

This project is my final project for BIS 634: Computational Methods for Informatics at Yale University. 

## Project Intro/Objective
The objective of the project was to select a dataset of interest, standardize it, and provide a web interface for analyzing the data. I downloaded the bank customer churn dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gauravtopre/bank-customer-churn-dataset). I performed data preprocessing, implemented analyses and modeling(KNN, SVM) to predict whether a customer would churn or not. Then, I made a web interface that allows users to select one of several analysis options, specify any parameters, and visualize the results using Flask.
